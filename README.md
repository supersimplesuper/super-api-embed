This is a JavaScript wrapper around the SuperAPI UI embed. It is designed to make interacting with the embed in the frontend easier.

## Development

### Getting started

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run setup`

To enable deployment, you will need to:

1. Set up the `NPM_TOKEN` secret in GitHub Actions ([Settings > Secrets > Actions](https://github.com/gjuchault/typescript-library-starter/settings/secrets/actions))
2. Give `GITHUB_TOKEN` write permissions for GitHub releases ([Settings > Actions > General](https://github.com/gjuchault/typescript-library-starter/settings/actions) > Workflow permissions)

### ASDF

We use ASDF to mange the versions of tools required for development on this library.

### TypeScript

Leverages [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild) for blazing-fast builds but keeps `tsc` to generate `.d.ts` files.
Generates a single ESM build.

Commands:

- `build`: runs type checking, then ESM and `d.ts` files in the `build/` directory
- `clean`: removes the `build/` directory
- `type:dts`: only generates `d.ts`
- `type:check`: only runs type checking
- `type:build`: only generates ESM

### Tests

TypeScript Library Starter uses [Node.js's native test runner](https://nodejs.org/api/test.html). Coverage is done using [c8](https://github.com/bcoe/c8) but will switch to Node.js's one once out.

Commands:

- `test`: runs test runner
- `test:watch`: runs test runner in watch mode
- `test:coverage`: runs test runner and generates coverage reports

### Format & lint

This template relies on the combination of [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) â€” through [TypeScript-ESLint](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint) for linting, and [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) for formatting.
It also uses [cspell](https://github.com/streetsidesoftware/cspell) to ensure correct spelling.

Commands:

- `format`: runs Prettier with automatic fixing
- `format:check`: runs Prettier without automatic fixing (used in CI)
- `lint`: runs ESLint with automatic fixing
- `lint:check`: runs ESLint without automatic fixing (used in CI)
- `spell:check`: runs spell checking

### Releasing

Under the hood, this library uses [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) and [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli).
The goal is to avoid manual release processes. Using `semantic-release` will automatically create a GitHub release (hence tags) as well as an npm release.
Based on your commit history, `semantic-release` will automatically create a patch, feature, or breaking release.

Commands:

- `cz`: interactive CLI that helps you generate a proper git commit message, using [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli)
- `semantic-release`: triggers a release (used in CI)
